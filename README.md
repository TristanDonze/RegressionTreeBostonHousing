# Regression Tree on Boston Housing Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a regression tree model on the Boston Housing dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression tree model to predict house prices in Boston based on various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and accessibility to highways. The Boston Housing dataset is a well-known dataset used in regression tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset. It contains 506 observations on 14 variables.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TristanDonze/RegressionTreeBostonHousing.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
cd RegressionTreeBostonHousing
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook RegressionTreeBostonHousing.ipynb
```

4. Run the notebook cells to see the implementation and results.
